### Retrosheet Data Source

#### Parser Generated CSV Files

The csv files must be generated by parsing the play-by-play data files.  The scripts will put the parsed csv files in:  `../data/retrosheet/parsed`.

The **cwdaily** parser generates statistics per player per game.  Attributes are prefixed by b for batter, p for pitcher and f_{pos} for fielder where pos is one of P, C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, LF, CF, RF.

The **cwgame** parser generates statistics per game for both teams.

#### Retrosheet Data Dictionary

The retrosheet_datadictionary.py script will generate a description of the output of the cwdaily and cwgame parsers.

This script has been run and the descriptions have been saved to:  `data/retrosheet/cwdaily_datadictionary.txt` and `data/retrosheet/cwgame_datadictionary.txt`

### How to Build Retrosheet Parsers on Linux

If you do not already have a build environment:

1. sudo apt install gcc
2. sudo apt install build-essential

cd to the source directory:

1. ./configure
2. make
3. sudo make install

Result

1. The cw command line tools will be installed in /usr/local/bin.
2. The cw library will be installed in /usr/local/lib.

To allow the command line tools to find the shared libraries, add the following to your .bashrc and then: source .bashrc
`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib`
