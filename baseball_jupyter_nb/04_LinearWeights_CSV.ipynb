    "# Model Runs per Half Inning With Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Runs scored per half-inning will be modeled using multivariate linear regression for singles, doubles, triples, home runs, and other types of plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression models are good explanatory models.  The coefficient in front of \"singles\" for example, tells how much each single contributes towards scoring a run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable, runs, is a count.  Its distribution is far from normal which suggests that linear regression may not be the optimal predictive model.  Nevertheless, a linear model can be fit which predicts well and is easy to understand.  As the primary goal is understanding rather than having the highest possible predictive accuracy, a linear model will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create a DataFrame that has stats per half inning.  As the output of the cwevent parser is missing some necessary fields, I have added these fields by parsing the Retrosheet event file using regular expressions.  These new fields were verified to be 100% consistent with those created by the cwgame parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseball Assumptions\n",
    "* The goal of each offensive half-inning is to score as many runs as possible\n",
    "* The goal of each defensive half-inning is to allow as few runs as possible\n",
    "  \n",
    "The above assumptions are not entirely correct for the home half of the 9th or later innings in which the offensive team is trying to end the game with a win, and the defensive team is trying to prevent the game from ending with a loss.  To account for this, only the first 8 innings of play will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some games have less than 8 complete innings.  This is usually due to rain.  As it is difficult for either team to predict when an umpire will call a game short of the 9th, the strategy employed in the bottom of the 9th or later, arguably does not apply in these games.  Shortened games will be included in the model.  Shortened games are rare, making up only 0.3% of all games since 2000."

    "\n",
    "The cwevent parser output is described at: http://chadwick.sourceforge.net/doc/cwevent.html\n",
    "\n",
    "cwevent does not produce a field for so, sb, cs, bk, bb, ibb, hbp, and xi. These fields were added by custom parsing of the cwevent field, event_tx.  This was done prior to creating the wrangled event csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "cwevent also has a h_cd field with values of 1, 2, 3, 4 for single, double, triple, home run, but for ease of processing, a boolean field was added for each.  When the event data is grouped by half-inning, the boolean values can be summed to get the total number of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs per half-inning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As cwevent has been used and tested for years, I made no attempt to rewrite it.  Rather I augmented its output by parsing its event_tx field, and then verified that when aggregated, these new fields exactly match the output of the cwgame parser."

    "\n",
    "A sacrifice fly in this model is worth slightly more than a single or an error.  As a baseball enthusiast, I would have expected a sacrifice fly to be worth slightly less.  It may be that the sacrifice fly results in slightly more runs because the scenarios in which it can occur, are more favorable to run scoring.  (This leads to the concept of the Run Expectancy Matrix which will be covered in a later notebook.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Above we see that the value of a double is not twice that of a single, nor are the triple and home runs as valuable as suggested by the computation of the slugging percentage.  In Sabermetrics, this leads to the concept of a weighted-on-base-average (wOBA) that uses weights for single, double, triple and home run that are similar to those computed above.\n",

    "A simple linear model for understanding which plays contribute to runs in a half-inning was created. This linear model was able to account for 78% of the variance in the runs scored per half-inning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a metric which weighs each player's singles, doubles, triples and home runs by the coefficients found in the linear model will better represent a player's ability to create runs than slugging percentage.  There are other refinements that could be made, but a simple linear model based off data for each half-inning of play is an excellent starting point."
